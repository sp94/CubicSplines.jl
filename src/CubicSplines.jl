Implementation is based on:
[1]: Akima, Hiroshi (1970). "A new method of interpolation and smooth curve fitting
    based on local procedures". Journal of the ACM. 17: 589–602.

Original module by Samuel J. Palmer, see https://github.com/sp94/CubicSplines.jl
Modified by Stefan Mathis to allow for customized extrapolation and to use a
binary search for interval identification.

"""
Construct an Akima spline according to [1]. In addition to the original method,
this implementation also allows for customized extrapolation at both spline
sides. The extrapolation behaviour is defined by the coefficients of a 3rd degree
polynomial which can be given as additional keyword arguments extrapl and extrapr
to the constructor. extrapl and/or extrapr should be either "nothing" or a
set of coefficients.

Case 1: Extrapolation is set to "nothing"
================================================================================
In this case, the default quadratic extrapolation according to section 2.3 of [1]
is used to construct the spline and the spline throws an error when evaluated
outside its boundaries.

Case 2: Extrapolation is set to a vector
================================================================================
The container is given as a n-element collection of values:
    extrapl = [p1, p2, p3, ..., pn]
which are used to evaluate the following function:
    y = p0 + p1*(x-x3) + p2*(x-x3)^2 + p3*(x-x3)^3 + ... + pn*(x-x3)^n
The constant p0 is equal to y3 by definition (continuous spline). x3 and y3
are the first/last datapoint values respectively.
